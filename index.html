        <p> Here I am a year later, and you can really see how much I've matured. I  was just recently
            hired by a company offering me $40K a year to start. With 250K in debt to HGSA, I can afford
            a small room above a bowling alley, And premium meals at Mcdonalds, </p>

            <p> I had no idea what I was getting into when I decided to join HGSA.
                My older brother died trying to become a software dev, There was no choice, I Had to grow up quick 
                if I was going to survive.

        <p> This was me celebrating after building my very first web page. <br> This bootcamp was so intense,
            They gave us 24 hours to figure <br> out how to make a fully functional api intergrate with amazons
            database, Those of us who could not finish, were forced into <br> brutal and bloody combat just to 
            retain our spot within the program.  
        </p> </div>

                <p> I wish I had never join HGSA, Within the first week I saw another classmate tossed to a pack
                    of hungery wolves just because He didn't understands Amazon web service structure, I still remember his
                    very last words "please I just need one more day... Please" ahhhhhhh!!!!!.

            <p> within 6 months my skills advanced so much, I got recruited by SHILD, and was working with the likes of Captain America And
                iron-man. Even though I feel like my job is importain, sometime I feel like I don't know who I am anymore.
                HGSA made me see the world for what it really is, A cold and destitute terrain. <br> Someone needs to change it, and that someone is me
