    <p> use these tags to create /write paragrahs on your webpage, and when I say paragraphs I mean long sentences that can go on and on 
         and on, and on, and on, lol:) <br> I think you get the point </p>

   
    <!-- this is how you add pictures/ images within the src="" .  the alt="" is if the image dose not load, what alternative do you want the user to see-->
    <img src=" this is where you put the picture URL " alt="   put text here just in case the image dose not load. ">


     <!--  if you wanted to set a link  for another web page use this tag.. the space in between the ending tags is where you can tell user to click the link  
           this is called an anchor tag-->
     <a href=" website/ page  URL link here "> click here to meet beautiful lonely singles lol </a>



      <!--  just like in python or javascript you can nest tags.. for example...   this is a anchor link nested within a paragraph tags-->
      <p> Here is the link to    <a href=" Add URL here "> click to give Michael all your  <em> money </em>  </a>    </p>

      <section>   to create seperate section within/ on the webpage  you can use these section tags..
                  your most likely gonna have several of these tags throughout your HTML to seperate the sections
